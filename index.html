		<div>How to play live slot machine.
“She worked so hard life continue to deal her a bad hand”  “He was born with a silver spoon in his mouth”  “It's  not  what you know but who you know”  The pervasiveness of the above quotes reveals that fate as well as our efforts affect our lives. life is like playing a slot  machine, you invest your money and time in  life’s  slot machine but then you have to pull the handle and the one armed bandit  rewards or punishes your investment. You have two resources to invest in life’s slotmachine time and money.
How you begin your life determines how you will play it. Those lucky few born with with silver spoons lead very different  different lives than those born into poverty. The Slot machine of life lets you see how what you start with in life will affect how you live your life.
You can start as poor, with a middle income or rich. Poor start with $2000  middle income $30000 and super rich start with $100,000. You can choose your card (how you start your life) or let fate do it for you. If you let fate choose, which is the way it happens in real life, the odds are %50 you will be poor, %40 you will have a middle income, and only %10 you will begin life rich. If, however,  you wish to experiment to see how  what you have to begin with affects how you play you can choose your own card. As you play the game from different starting positions notice how your strategies change and how your  status boards at the end of the different games the differ.
By playing  life’s slot machine you can simulate 30 years of your life beginning with your graduation from high school. 
Your parents have given you $30,000 in mother nature gives you 12 hours a day. You can invest these assets in the life slot machine for 30 years (you can pull the lever 30 times) and your goal like anyone playing life’s slot machine is to wind up with the big reward how you invest your assets and what ladylove can't you determine your life's reward,
There are four areas on life’s playing board in which you can invest;  Education, Work,  Recreation and Living.  In addition to these major areas of investment you can change the basic conditions of your life by getting married.  You may also spend money you don't have by borrowing or not spending money you do have by saving.  Both saving and borrowing have costs and benefits.  When you borrow you pay interest and when you save you get interest.  Finally when you have made all your life decisions, where and how to spend your time and money you must pull the lever of fate and life’s slot machine will either punish you or reward you.  Now all you need to know is how to play lfes slot machine.
Before you pull Life’s lever of fate you  must make choices as to where you wish to place your bets.  Life’s  slot machine gives you four  things  you can bet on Education, Work,  Living and  Recreation.  You also have two types of assets you can bet on life’s  slot machine,  money and time.  You begin with $30,000 but you get at the beginning of the game and 12 hour time coins which are renewed after every pull the lever. Everyday is a new day.  Every year is a new year.
You bet both time and money in life’s slot machine. You bet both time and money on education. You bet  only time on work.  You bet both time and money on recreation. You bet only money on living.  There is one catch, in order pull the lever you must either buy a living or go to school. In order to play life’s slot machine you must live.
The rules of lifeEducationGuidance counselors usually refer to  the  reward you get from education as postponed reward. They   call it that because you don't get paid for going to school, no immediate reward but instead more years of school qualifies you for a better job better jobs increase the probability of higher income higher income gives you the ability to put a higher standard of living the biggest source of reward in life.
Education level   -    Qualifies you for      -    jobhigh school ----------unskilled laborOne year college ---------clerks/ salesAssociates degree ----------skilled laborFour-year college degree---- professionalPostgraduate degree-----  manager /professional
You begin life with a high school education. To acquire more education requires expenditures of both time and money.  The higher you go the more the cost in time and money.  Two-year colleges cost $6000 year and eight hours a day for two years.  It leads to an associate degree and the credits can't be transferred to a higher level of school. Four-year college cost $10,000 and 10 hours a day for your for four years.  Graduate school cost 12,000 a year 12 hours a day for three years and requires a degree from a four-year college.EducationLike anything else in life is affected by Life’s slot machine.  Good things and  bad things happen to you while going to school. Another thing about education is that part of the cost of education are dorm fees this means that while in school you don't have buy a standard of living sort of like the army  abut then again so is the food.
WorkThe primary source of money for playing life slot machine aside from the 30,000 your parents gave you his work. The highest income you can get from a job and this Life is 100,000 a year, the lowest is 8000 a year.  The probability of receiving these incomes is related to the job level, luck and seniority.
The higher the job the greater the probability of higher incomes. Notice ,however, the word probability which means even college graduates can get low income and high school graduates can get high ones,  although the probability of either is not great.  Seniority is also a factor; the longer you stay at one job level is greater probably you have getting a higher income.
Unskilled Work  - making big Macs, washing dishes and manual labor requires a high school education You may work part time at this job by the hour.  Full-time requires eight hours.,\Clerk/Sales-  Bank tellers, insurance sales, car dealers, low-level managers -  require at least one year college- You may work this job part time but only in four hour blocks,  Full-time requires eight hours
Skilled Labor - Electricians, Lab Tech, Small Business Owners - requires a two-year college degreeNo part-time,  full-time requires eight hours.Professional - Engineers, Teachers , Middle level managers - requires a four-year college degree.No part-time full-time requires ten hours.
Manager /Professional-  Doctors, lawyers, upper-level managers.- Requires a graduate degree.No part-time, full-time requires 12 hours.
The paths  to happiness (reward) in LifeThe primary source of reward in  life is not education or work but rather your standard of living,  recreation and marriage, Standard of living   Your standard of living is your primary source reward in life, with the exception of students everyone has to buy standard of living to play the  life slot machine The central fact of life is that you have to live it.  Another fact of life is that poor people don't have much fun and rich people do.  The poorer your standard of living the less reward you get; if you live in poverty you actually lose reward. Here is what you get for your money.Standard of living ----cost----Reward.
1.Poverty ------$10,000  (-10 )2. Low standard----- 20,000 -----(0)3.  Medium Standard 30,000 ----(10)4.  High standard---- 50,000-----(20)5.  Luxury -----70,000---(50 )6.  Filthy Rich----- 100,000 ------(80)
RecreationHaving fun is fun and in life is a source of reward.  Recreation  costs both time and money.  The more you spend of each on recreation the more fun and the   greater your reward. Your reward as it relates to the rest of life is fun divided by 1000.
What you do for fun affects your life and your reward.  Drinking, partying and skydiving may be more fun than going to the movies but they are far more dangerous.  Thus although living dangerously may give you more immediate reward,  it doubles your recreation reward points but it also increases your chance of death or worse killing someone else and having your life with no reward nobody goes to the funeral of a drunkard who commits manslaughter.
Marriage
After the honeymoon, marriage  settles down to a constant source of reward and throughout life this  this means 10 reward points a year. On the other  marriage although a constant source of reward is not without  its risks and costs. You run the risk of having your marriage go bad and the resulting divorce, , which will cost you both reward and money for number of years. You could also children which means you have to buy at least a low standard of living to support your children.  Remember marriage is for life unless you get divorced.
Finally word  about money
Borrowing (enables you to spend what you don't have)In LIFE you may find yourself temporarily short of cash. In LIFE, especially in the US,  the solution is to borrow.  The cost of borrowing is paying interest on your loans which compounded annually in LIFE.
Saving (not spending much you do have)There are several reasons for saving a LIFE. Either you wish to save for something in the future or you want to make money with your money,  no matter what your motive savings unlike borrowing directs interest stream into your savings rather than out of your pocket, as is the case with borrowing.You can also invest your money. The returns on investments are much higher then savings but the amounts needed to invest are greater. You must have a minimum of $50,000 to invest but the returns can be as high as 30%.

Life Strategies
Those  are the  rules of Life’s slot machine.  How you bet  your life, the strategies you use are up to you. Here are a few of the more frequent choices strategies.
Middle-class traditional--- four years college, a job and marriageYuppie---- graduate school, single ,luxury livingPlay -person ---- strategy 1 or 2 but investing mostly in recreation rather than the higher standards of living.School phobic ----less than four years of college, right into the workplace.
These are just a few strategies you can use playing Life's Slot Machine. Of course we are sure that you will devise your own, everyone likes to lead their own life. However, no matter what strategy you choose Life’s Slot Machine has a nasty habit of introducing just enough fate to change the course of your life  “the best laid plans of mice and men”. No matter what strategy of life you choose or what a particular year of life does to that strategy we would advise you to plan think.
